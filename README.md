# FriendConstellation

FriendConstellation is a Starboard web app.

The admin (Called a Starmaster) can create a list of players, 'Champions', and a list of tasks.
Each task is worth a certain amount of stars.

The Starmaster reviews the Competitor's attempts at the tasks and awards stars accordingly.
